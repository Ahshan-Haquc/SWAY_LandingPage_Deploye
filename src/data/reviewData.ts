They have a full body, holistic approach that also focuses you on your diet and general well being and fitness, as well as a targeted plan for your desired outcomes. I am training for a yacht race and looking to strengthen my upper body strength as well as my overall strength and balance, and have seen great results so far! The trainers are incredibly knowledgable and experienced, amazing value for money."

        text: "Working with the trainer and the Sway Method has been a real game-changer for me. As a coach myself, I thought I had a good understanding of my body and training, but what the trainer helped me realise was that I wasn’t moving as well as I could - and that was holding me back. The Sway Method isn’t just lifting weights or doing Pilates. It’s a mix of both, combined with proper coaching that focuses on how your body moves. Over the weeks, I’ve felt more stable, stronger in my lifts, and more aware of how I move day to day. My performance has improved massively - not just in training, but in general life too. The trainer’s attention to detail, clear explanations, and constant support made all the difference. Even as a coach, I wouldn’t have got here without them. Highly recommend it to anyone serious about improving how they train and move."

        text: "Absolutely loving these Pilates classes! What really sets them apart is the flexibility — I can join live 1-to-1 sessions or just do them on demand whenever it fits my schedule (super helpful being in a different time zone). The instructor is so knowledgeable and really personalizes each session. I feel stronger, more energized, and genuinely look forward to every class. Highly recommend if you’re looking for something that adapts to you."

Their expertise, motivation, and attention to detail are second to none. Every session is challenging yet rewarding, and they genuinely care about helping you achieve your goals.

        text: "Highly recommend! I started off a goal to address some sciatica but I’ve gained so much more. Every session is different and you really get pushed to work as hard as you can, with lots of attention to detail on form as well as nutrition. But as well as working hard it’s fun, which makes it easy to commit to!"

        text: "I was exercising on my own for 2 years with not so great results. My wife got me a PT for my birthday. At first I wasn't happy about it as I wanted to get a new monitor for my computer. But I have to admit the PT was a much better present. I've been with Dan (Sway) for almost 2 years. My trainer is very knowledgeable and motivates me to give my best on every session. I feel great, I've put quite a bit of muscle mass. He really cares about my results. Would recommend to anyone!"

I also ‘accidentally’ started properly working out for the first time and love it. I’ve lost over 10kg without really restricting calories. Both the PT and nutrition advice have been transformative, and I’m a happier, stronger and pain free version of myself."
